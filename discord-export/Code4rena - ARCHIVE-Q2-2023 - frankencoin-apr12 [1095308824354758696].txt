Any questions about the bot race can be posted in #bot-race-help, so we can keep the discussion here focused on the main competition.

I guess this sentence means that issues on `audits/blockbite-audit.pdf` are out of scope.
Anyway, the sentence is not perfect in the meaning. Can cause some dispute.
I suggest to edit that sentence.

@kronrod can you expand on the description of the auction mechanism?

- Is this to determine the market price of Frankencoin?
- Are there 3 actors? IE. Position's Owner, Challenger, Bidders

[04/12/2023 22:50] levijohnson (pinned)
hi @reentrant , the goal of the auction mechanism is to determine the fair price of the collateral, so that Frankencoin (XCHF) is always sufficiently backed and the system remains in balance. 

Yes, there are more than 2 actors: The position owner, the challenger and the bidders. 

Here's a slightly, but hopefully more conclusive, description from the frankecoin.com app: 

"Collateralized minting positions allow their owner to mint ZCHF against a collateral. Anyone can open new collateral positions and start minting ZCHF once the initialization period has passed. Positions that are not sufficiently collateralized can be challenged by anyone through an auction mechanism. When challenging a position, the challenger must provide some of the collateral to be auctioned off. If the highest bid in the subsequent auction is high enough to show that the position is sufficiently collateralized, the challenge is averted and the bidder gets the challengers collateral in exchange for the highest bid. If the highest bid is lower, the challenge is considered successful, the bidder gets the collateral from the position and the position is closed, distributing excess proceeds to the reserve and paying a reward to the challenger."


[04/12/2023 22:53] reentrant
thanks!  

About this line: `If the highest bid in the subsequent auction is high enough to show that the position is sufficiently collateralized...` 

- how is "sufficiently collateralized" determined?


[04/12/2023 23:05] escrow1337
just out of curiosity, why weren't the bugs in the audit (which were previously found) not fixed yet?


[04/12/2023 23:10] sovaslava9
Do you made changes in code (new functional ) from your previous audit? or code is the same from previous audit


[04/12/2023 23:18] reentrant
Not 100% sure, but the audit report says they audited from commit 0db42977b331bd25a12e3a6da767b7df18a5d66b, and there's a bunch of commits after that in the project repo (https://github.com/Frankencoin-ZCHF/FrankenCoin)

[04/12/2023 23:37] hermel007
"sufficiently collateralized" means that the price achieved in the auction is at least as high as the liquidation price of the position.


[04/12/2023 23:44] reentrant
Thanks! I'm going through the whitepaper and see that section 2 is helpful.  Is the whitepaper out of date to the implementation in the C4 repo?


[04/12/2023 23:48] hermel007
Yes, the paper is not entirely up to date. The basic idea is the same, but there are some subtle differences.

@kronrod Hi! where can we find the address of the reserve contract?  reserve.checkQualified(msg.sender, _helpers);


[04/12/2023 23:54] hermel007
that's the Equity contract. It is sometimes called reserve as it holds the reserves. it can be found by calling reserve() on the Frankencoin contract.


[04/12/2023 23:57] kartoonjoy
Pinned a message.


[04/13/2023 00:04] hermel007 (pinned)
In case you wonder about the differences. From the top of my mind, the most important ones are:
- "price" in the paper refers to the market price, whereas the variable position.price in the implementation refers to the liquidation price.
- the minter reserve was adjusted after the paper was written and the equity share allocation is completely different. It is probably best to ignore section 3 of the paper entirely and to instead refer to the gitbook documentation and the code comments.
- in the paper, the perspective is that you borrow 80 ZCHF but get liquidated once the collateral is worth less than (1+h)*80 = 100. In the implementation, the perspective is that you borrow the 100 ZCHF, but only get to use 80 as 20 is allocated to the reserve.
- the paper does not care about timing questions between providing the collateral and actually minting ZCHF. It assumes that these always happen together, whereas in the implementation, providing collateral and minting ZCHF are two separate steps.

overall, the paper is a good reference for the game theory behind Frankencoin, whereas the source code comments contain better information about the more subtle considerations of the actual implementation

        return uint64(block.number << BLOCK_TIME_RESOLUTION_BITS);
    }```


[04/13/2023 06:55] bean.eth2
where BLOCK_TIME_RESOLUTION_BITS is 24, moving block.number to the more significant 24 bits


[04/13/2023 06:59] bean.eth2
i think it scales the block_number to 16777216?

Since there were a few questions regarding the auction mechanism, I've just pushed an update to the gitbook documentation, describing the basic idea behind the auction design in an accessible way:

For the hairy details, it is still best to consult the code and its comments, but this should help as an entry point.

Challenges and Auctions
Challenges and the resulting auctions are a mechanism to ensure positions are backed by sound collateral.

No, suggestMinter only needs to be called if you propose a completely new way of minting. When opening a new position through the existing MintingHub, the existing MintingHub acts as the minter.

@carlitox477 have you tried *foundryup* to grab the latest version of the framework?


[04/14/2023 02:02] birdy0219
Also @carlitox477 a quick google has suggested a fix to a similar previous forge checksum error is to add a specific solc version in the *foundry.toml* file
My version is compiling everything fine with 0.8.19 so you could add this line to *foundry.toml* ```solc_version = "0.8.19"```

initialCollateral: the initial amount of collateral. It will be automatically transferred to the newly created position during the call. As the minting hub is executing the transfer, an according allowance must be present. @kronrod  I dont understand 2nd sentence


[04/15/2023 09:25] hermel007
before opening the position, the caller must set an ERC20 allowance in another transaction, i.e. collateral().approve(mintinghub, initialCollateral)

yes, there could even be chains of delegation


[04/15/2023 15:35] hermel007
some wardens approached me about the Frankencoin.suggestMinter function and the totalSupply == 0 check. The idea here is that as long as total supply is 0, this was freshly deployed and the deployer should be able to immediately add the first minters without paying a fee or having to wait. after that, the deployer should mint the first ZCHF and henceforth a fee and a waiting period is necesary to suggest a minter.

equity() returns the total reserve minus the minter's reserve. If Frankencoin was a bank, this would be the equity capital in the balance sheet.

nothing to be sorry for sir, we are all here to learn
Challenge is a mechanism that allows the system to get rid of bad positions
A position is considered to be a bad one when the value of its collateral is less than the value of what it borrowed

why bidder and challanger are different? whats role of bidder? doesnt challanger just pays collateral he offers


[04/16/2023 08:59] hermel007
the challenge is the one triggering the auction. the challenger basically says: I do not believe this collateral is as valuable as the position owner claims, and to prove it, I put up the same collateral for sale in an auction.

Then the bidders come in and start bidding. And if the highest bid is indeed below the value that the position owner provided, the challenger wins.

[04/16/2023 11:12] hermel007
If the challenge fails, that means that there was a bidder that is willing to pay the liquidation price for the collateral. In that case, the bidder gets the collateral provided by the challenger and the challenger gets the bid. The owner of the position is completely unaffected.
This changes if the position has expired: in that case, every challenge succeeds which essentially means that the collateral is sold to the highest bidder and the system makes a nice profit.

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/16/2023 11:12] hermel007
the liquidation price is the price stored in position. if the highest bid is higher, the challenge is averted. if the highest bid is lower, the challenge succeeds.

If the challenger wins, what will happen on the position?


[04/16/2023 17:25] hermel007
If the challenger wins, the collateral of the position is being sold to the highest bidder. And if there is no collateral left, the position is sent into eternal cooldown in internalWithdrawCollateral() such that nothing can be minted any more.

In the Alice example of the auction documentation (https://docs.frankencoin.com/positions/auctions), Alice would keep the ZCHF she minted, if a challenge to the pool succeeds right?
In that case, the opening of the unsound position would have been profitable for her, if the net gain she made is higher than the fees she had to pay for opening the position. Is my understanding correct? @kronrod

I believe you are right, the only way to close a position is by withdrawing all the collateral, although having the position denied I think it also renders it dead.


[04/17/2023 15:59] eyexploit
yep, denying position can only be done during initalization period, here it trying to avert challenge so I assume the intialization period over and position approved. I don't see how there's a way for minter to close his position as mention in comment.


[04/17/2023 16:01] janestebans
I think the comment tries to say that it wants to avoid the owner of the open position to mint the frankencoin to give a bit more of time so somebody else can open another challenge in this position. That is my take, but I can be wrong, this contract is kinda convoluted

check the MintingHub & Positions contract, I don't remember exactly which of the two contracts call that mint() function

One of the coolest things about the protocol is that it uses heavily game theory to keep everyone on their best behavior. When I saw that it only had 949 lines of code, I thought it would be easy to understand, but then realised I was very wrong.

Hi all, does zchf minting supposed to work on positions created via MintHub only ?

In foundry, I managed to mint zchf by creating a position via MintHub.

However when I create a position outside of MintHub and try to mint zchf by calling Position.mint() it reverts with ""EvmError: Revert""

Not sure if this is the right place for noob questions but I would greatly appreciate some guidance🙏


[04/21/2023 18:53] 0xstalin
yeah, zchf minting is supposed to work only if a valid minter is the one calling the mint() function
A valid minter can be the MintinHub contract, an authorized bridge ...

Hope you are working on it because of fun, the contest has already ended 🙂

gm... Sorry to be a pain but I'm feeling severely underpaid on this. I submitted a valid 0-day-vulnerability for this contest which could have caused a huge loss for the protocol. Informed the sponsor because the contract was deployed to mainnet already with 100k basically up for grabs. During that conversation, I was told I was the first one to find this issue. So anyway, I got 210$.... This really doesn't seem right (or if it is, where's the incentive for wardens to report these kind of issues?)

[05/26/2023 07:32] hermel007
It wasn't unique, but ChrisTina was the first to report it to me, thereby allowing me to save all the funds from the deployed alpha version. While the contest rules do not care about the timing of the repost. I do. So I'll send ChrisTina an additional reward outside the competition.
